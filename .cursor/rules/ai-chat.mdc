# AI Chatbot Development Document for Cognisheet

## Introduction and Overview

The AI chatbot for Cognisheet is designed to make spreadsheet analysis intuitive and powerful for non-technical users. By understanding user requests conversationally, the chatbot unlocks advanced capabilities without requiring formula expertise or manual data handling. The chatbot will:

- Analyze spreadsheet data and generate visualizations powered by Python.
- Create formulas based on user needs.
- Produce charts and import them directly into the spreadsheet.
- Research and scrape the web to pull external data into the spreadsheet.
- Extract text and structured information from PDFs and images.

This document provides a clear plan for developing these features, ensuring the chatbot is seamlessly integrated into the existing spreadsheet application.

## Functional Requirements

The AI chatbot must support the following features:

1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**  
   - Read and analyze data in the current spreadsheet.  
   - Generate Python-powered visualizations (e.g., graphs, plots) based on user requests.  
   - Display visualizations directly within the spreadsheet interface.  

2. **Formula Generation**  
   - Understand user requests for calculations and generate appropriate spreadsheet formulas.  
   - Insert the generated formulas into the spreadsheet for immediate use.  

3. **Chart Generation**  
   - Create charts (e.g., bar, line, pie) from spreadsheet data based on user commands.  
   - Import the charts directly into the spreadsheet view.  

4. **Web Research and Scraping**  
   - Perform web searches and scrape data based on user queries (e.g., "Find Airbnbs near Disneyland California").  
   - Use tools like `@firecrawl_dev` and `@ExaAILabs` for efficient and structured data retrieval.  
   - Insert the scraped data into the spreadsheet in an organized format.  

5. **Document Data Extraction**  
   - Extract text and structured data (e.g., tables) from PDFs and images.  
   - Import the extracted information into the spreadsheet for further use.

## Development Approach

Each feature requires a specific approach to ensure it is user-friendly, efficient, and integrated smoothly with the spreadsheet.

### 1. Data Analysis and Visualization
- Use a system to interpret user requests (e.g., "Show sales trends") and analyze the spreadsheet data.  
- Enable Python-based tools to create visualizations like graphs or plots.  
- Design a way to show these visualizations inside the spreadsheet, such as in a panel or pop-up.

### 2. Formula Generation
- Build the chatbot to recognize what calculations users want and turn them into spreadsheet formulas.  
- Ensure the formulas are added to the right cells and work correctly, even with tricky data like empty cells.

### 3. Chart Generation
- Use the spreadsheet’s built-in charting tools or add simple charting options.  
- Let the chatbot figure out what kind of chart and data to use from user requests (e.g., "Make a pie chart of expenses").  
- Automate adding the charts to the spreadsheet.

### 4. Web Research and Scraping
- Connect the chatbot to web tools like `@firecrawl_dev` and `@ExaAILabs` to search and grab data.  
- Turn user questions into search tasks and organize the results (e.g., Airbnb listings into rows and columns).  
- Place the data neatly into the spreadsheet.

### 5. Document Data Extraction
- Add tools to read text and tables from PDFs and images quickly.  
- Match the extracted data to spreadsheet cells or sections.  
- Ask users for clarification if needed (e.g., "Which table do you want?").

## Integration with Spreadsheet App

The AI chatbot will live inside the spreadsheet interface, likely as a sidebar or chat window, so users can access it without leaving their work.

- **Connection**: Link the chatbot to the spreadsheet so it can read and change data as needed.  
- **Instant Updates**: Make sure visualizations, charts, and data appear right away after a request.  
- **Access**: Give the chatbot permission to work with the spreadsheet’s current data and layout.

## Roadmap for Implementation

Assuming the base spreadsheet app is ready, here’s how to build and add the AI chatbot:

### 3. Implement Data Analysis and Visualization
- Add Python support to analyze data and create visualizations.  
- Build a way to show these visualizations in the spreadsheet.

### 4. Add Formula Generation
- Teach the chatbot to make formulas from user requests.  
- Add steps to check and place formulas in the spreadsheet.

### 5. Integrate Chart Generation
- Use or improve the spreadsheet’s charting features.  
- Make the chatbot create and insert charts automatically.

### 6. Enable Web Research and Scraping
- Link the chatbot to `@firecrawl_dev` and `@ExaAILabs` for web tasks.  
- Create a system to organize and add scraped data to the spreadsheet.

### 7. Implement Document Data Extraction
- Add tools to pull text and tables from PDFs and images.  
- Set up a way to move this data into the spreadsheet.

### 8. Testing and Iteration
- Test each feature on its own and with the spreadsheet.  
- Try it with real users to see if it’s easy to use and works well.  
- Fix any issues and improve based on feedback.

## Testing and Validation

To make sure the AI chatbot works perfectly, follow these testing steps:

- **Feature Testing**: Check each part (like formulas or data extraction) works correctly.  
- **App Testing**: Ensure the chatbot fits into the spreadsheet without problems.  
- **User Testing**: Let users try it and confirm it meets their needs.  
- **Speed Testing**: Make sure it runs smoothly, even with big data or complex tasks.
